> **Note:** Declarative diagramming involves the creation of diagrams through a declarative approach, encompassing a range from flowcharts to organization charts. In this methodology, users define the relationships and logic of the diagram's elements using a formal language, as opposed to the traditional method of manually placing and connecting shapes on a canvas.
