# diagram_as_code_python

> **Note:** Declarative diagramming involves the creation of diagrams through a declarative approach, encompassing a range from flowcharts to organization charts. In this methodology, users define the relationships and logic of the diagram's elements using a formal language, as opposed to the traditional method of manually placing and connecting shapes on a canvas.
>
> While this approach may not be the most practical for sporadically generating individual diagrams, it proves highly advantageous for automation processes reliant on reusable templates and their seamless customization.

from diagrams.aws.database import ElastiCache, RDS
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB
from diagrams.aws.network import Route53

with Diagram("Clustered Web Services", show=False):
    dns = Route53("dns")
    lb = ELB("lb")

    with Cluster("Services"):
        svc_group = [ECS("web1"),
                     ECS("web2"),
                     ECS("web3")]

    with Cluster("DB Cluster"):
        db_primary = RDS("userdb")
        db_primary - [RDS("userdb ro")]

    memcached = ElastiCache("memcached")

    dns >> lb >> svc_group
    svc_group >> db_primary
    svc_group >> memcached
